Truth_Evaluator:
1) The program first takes a number of propositional variables (P1, P2... Pn) as an input.
2) It then takes a statement involving these variables as an input.
3) The program parses the statement and outputs "True" if the given assignment satisfies the sentence or "False" if it does not.

Truth_Table_Creator:
1) The program first takes a statement involving variables P1, P2... as an input.
2) It then creates a truth table for this statement and outputs it.
3) The program then outputs whether the statement is a tautology, contradiction or contingency.
